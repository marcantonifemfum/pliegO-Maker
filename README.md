_Turn one simple sheet of paper into a little awesome book_

PliegO-Maker is now on N-up stage. We develop in PostScript language a page layout strategy, to impose pages (side by side in a simple sheet of paper), in order to perform dynamic grids to compose randomly, texts and images.

The liquid layout works simultaneously with the N-up workflow, not with a composed pre-rendered pages. The «liquid layout» is based on the behavior of typography patterns. The Em module (type) as a classic canon of page construction, reloaded onto digital era. The preprint, in PDF format output, allows to work with layers, tagged contents, annotations, metadata and so on.

A «pliego» is a simple sheet of paper that once folded turns into a microbook (a real pocket-size one, indeed). It only needs a printer, a little do-it-yourself and an age 10 minutes for reading it.
